# Solar-Power-Dynamics

**Overview**
This project explores the dynamics of solar power generation, comparing the performance of Random Forest and Linear Regression models. The goal is to uncover key factors influencing energy production and optimize solar power plant efficiency.

**Key Findings**
1- Energy Production Patterns: Analysis revealed reduced energy generation at night, with significant seasonal increases during spring and summer.
2- Influential Factors: Air temperature positively influenced power generation, while regular air pressure enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. A negative correlation was found between relative air humidity and energy production.
3- Modeling Insights: The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression, achieving a higher RÂ² score and lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model's accuracy suggests its potential for optimizing solar energy generation.

**Project Structure**
1- Data Exploration: Analysis of key features such as WindSpeed, Sunshine, and Radiation.
2- Modeling: Comparative analysis of Random Forest and Linear Regression models.
3- Evaluation: Visual and statistical evaluation of model performance, including error distribution and accuracy metrics.

**Conclusion**
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance in predicting solar power generation, highlighting its potential for optimizing energy production in solar power plants. These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable energy solutions.
